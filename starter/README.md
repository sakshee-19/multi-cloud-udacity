DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a fully managed, highly available, NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It ensures millisecond range latency at any scale and supports key-value and document data structures. Apart from the core features of a database, DynamoDB provides some amazing additional features like backups, high availability, and scalability to make developers work easier.

Cosmos DB
Cosmos DB is another highly available, horizontally scalable NoSQL database service. It is offered by Azure and is known as a multi-model database service. It enables customers to instantly develop and distribute their apps across Azure data centers without any prior configuration. In addition, it is available in all Azure regions and replicates its data across multiple data centers in the network because it is part of Azure.

Shared Attributes for DynamoDB and Cosmos DB
Both DynamoDB and Cosmos DB allow you to create highly available, reliable, and scalable serverless NoSQL databases. In addition, they both provide fully managed services and make it easier for the developer to configure the database and proceed with their applications with minimal intervention.

On the other hand, DynamoDB models data as key-value and documents, whereas Cosmos DB models data as key-value, documents, graphs DBMS, and in wide column stores. Also, Cosmos DB is designed to be a drop-in replacement for a typical relational database that supports SQL queries, whereas DynamoDB doesn't support ANSI SQL.
